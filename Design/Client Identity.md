# Client Identification

Clients need to be uniquely identifiable by the aggregator.

IP uniquely identifies each client

Ideally, a client class should exist with methods to :

    - Copy the Files for a certain set of experiments
    - Participate in an FL experiment.
    - Check what experiments have run on it
